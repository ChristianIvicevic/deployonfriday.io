This is my personal blog that I developed while learning [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
Styling is entirely derived from [Dan Abramovs blog](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io) with minor tweaks here and there.

For testing contributions locally you can run `yarn`, then `yarn dev`, then open http://localhost:3000.
